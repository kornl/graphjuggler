Welcome!

The goal of the project Graph Morphism Juggler is to develop a
full-featured tool to assist research in algebraic graph theory.

The current version already features an intuitive graphical user
interface and rudimentary methods to calculate graph endomorphisms,
factor graphs and products of graphs as well as a TeX export function.

Plans for future versions include features like enhanced endomorphism
sorting, representation/categorization, green's relations, epi/mono
factorization functions with calculations of epimorphism distortion
spectra, graph congruence (semi-)lattices, visualized N- and
polyhedral Hom-complexes as well as analysis tools for topological
properties.
