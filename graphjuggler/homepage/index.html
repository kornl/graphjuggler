<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<a href="http://sourceforge.net"><img src="http://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?group_id=129400&amp;type=3" width="125" height="37" border="0" alt="SourceForge.net Logo" /></a>
<p>The goal of the project Graph Morphism Juggler is to develop a
full-featured tool to assist research in algebraic graph theory.</p>

<p>The current version already features an intuitive graphical user interface
and rudimentary methods to calculate graph endomorphisms, factor graphs
and products of graphs as well as a TeX export function.

<p>Plans for future versions include features like enhanced endomorphism 
sorting, representation/categorization, green's relations, epi/mono
factorization functions with calculations of epimorphism distortion
spectra, graph congruence (semi-)lattices, visualized N- and polyhedral
Hom-complexes as well as analysis tools for topological properties.</p>
